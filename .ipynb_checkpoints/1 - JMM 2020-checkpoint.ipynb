    "# Teaching Mathematics with Jupyter and PreText\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mathematics course that is built heavily around the use of Jupyter as an in-class tool,  such as a Data Science,Mathematical Modeling, or even Linear Algebra or Calculus courses it makes sense to use Jupyter to compose the coursenotes. The prose surrounding the computations depends on the results of the computation for example, or the figures beingproduced are dependent on choices made in the computations.  Jupyter can even be used as an interactive presentationduring these classes.The resulting notebook files can be easily published via Github or similar services, or exported to PDF or HTML.However, these are unsatisfactory ways of sharing the material for some uses, and one might prefer to bundle the notesinto something more like an online textbook.  In this presentation we will give an overview of the use of Jupyter as anin-class tool in these kinds of mathematics courses, and then discuss a conversion script for turning Jupyter notebooksinto PreTeXt XML files for publishing as an online textbook (nicely formatted for mobile devices).\n",

    "## What is Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jupyter* is primarily an interactive shell for Python with some additional functionality, mainly a *markdown* language syntax for cells that allows one to wrap Python code cells with descriptive text with some formating options. *Markdown* is a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) language for typsetting similar to the language used by Wikipedia. For our purposes, the most important feature is that it includes escape environments for typesetting mathematical expressions in $\\LaTeX$ in line and as equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int x^2 dx = 2 x + C $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are commands for bullets and numeration;\n",
    "- **Bold**, *Italics*, and ~Strikeout~\n",
    "- [html tags](https://virgilpierce.github.io/frontmatter-1.html)\n",
    "- Section and subsection headings (see above)\n",
    "- Importing images (using an HTML / XML type of syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"IMG_4020.jpg\" style=\"width:200px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- A quote environment (see below)\n",
    "\n",
    "and probably some other options I have not discovered yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter functions as a webserver either on your local machine or running through a cloud service called a Jupyter Hub. More about Jupyter Hubs at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not seen Python before, today's presentation will be a gentle introduction. From the Python Foundation's website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data  structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. \n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who is realitvely new to the language I can say that my experience has been:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. it is a powerful yet easy to learn language with far fewer things that need to be front loaded compared to C++ (no declarations), \n",
    "2. it is much easier to read Python code than other languages (in fact this is a primary focus of the design decisions),\n",
    "3. the interactive environment (like we are using in Jupyter) makes it behave like matlab (you can run a command and then see what happens), \n",
    "4. it was written by a mathematician, and is used extensively for computations in math and science,\n",
    "5. its plotting functions use the same syntax as matlab: plot( x, y, 'b-' )\n",
    "6. it is free and open (beer and liberty)\n",
    "\n",
    "Downsides, as a programing language are the obvious\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because it is not a compiled language like C++ it is substantially slower,\n",
    "2. Because it is more of a programing language than matlab, you may need to worry about the structure of variables and what they represent at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assert, and will try to show you here, that we can insulate students from the issues that occur with downside 2. Downside 1 should not be an issue in most of the cases I have in mind for a class. In my work, 1 has only been an issue in some combinatorial problems where I am trying to iterate over all permutations of size $n > 12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a tool like Jupyte/Python in Teaching Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "A major frustration in my teaching has been when I ask students to use a tool that I know is unrelated to what they would use in the 'real-world', in their careers, or in other classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python has evolved to be a major tool used in STEM, from small minor tasks to major research projects**. \n",
    "- **Jupyter/Python is a very common tool for Data Science and Mathematics in industry and were identified as important for candidates to have experience with**\n",
    "\n",
    "I also find that programming languages do have some things in common with human languages, and one of those commonalities is that if you do not use it, you will lose it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asking students to use and interact with Python outside of a their programming class will improve their understanding of the language**\n",
    "\n",
    "But its not just for students who have had a Python class, it is possible to design your course materials to function as a gentle introduction to the language, similarly to how matlab or mathematica can be introduced to students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The language is human readable**\n",
    "- **With Jupyter, the code that students see can be wrapped in detailed explanations**\n",
    "- **With Jupyter, hyperlinks to even more details can be added**\n",
    "- **I will show you some techniques for 'locking' cells to limit what students can change in a notebook, allowing you to create worksheets and interactive notebooks that will be hard(er) for students to 'break'**\n",
